                <h2>"Father of Pakistan's atomic weapons program"</h2>
                <p><b>Abdul Qadeer Khan, NI, HI, FPAS</b> ,(Abdul Qadeer Khan; Urdu: عبد القدیر خان; 1 April 1936 to 10 October 2021),known as A. Q. Khan, was a Pakistani nuclear physicist and metallurgical engineer who is colloquially known as the "father of Pakistan's atomic weapons program".[a]

                    An emigre (Muhajir) from India who migrated to Pakistan in 1952, Khan was educated in the metallurgical engineering departments of Western European technical universities where he pioneered studies in phase transitions of metallic alloys, uranium metallurgy, and isotope separation based on gas centrifuges. After learning of India's "Smiling Buddha" nuclear test in 1974, Khan joined his nation's clandestine efforts to develop atomic weapons when he founded the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) in 1976 and was both its chief scientist and director for many years.
                                                            
                    After his death on 10 October 2021, he was given a state funeral at Faisal Mosque before being buried at the H-8 graveyard in Islamabad.</p>

                <h4>Biography</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In 1972, Khan joined the Physics Dynamics Research Laboratory (or in Dutch: FDO), an engineering firm subsidiary of Verenigde Machinefabrieken (VMF) based in Amsterdam, from Brabers's recommendation</li>
                    <li>The FDO was a subcontractor for Ultra-Centrifuge Nederland of the, British-German-Dutch uranium enrichment consortium, URENCO which was operating a uranium enrichment plant in Almelo and employed gaseous centrifuge method to assure a supply of nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants in the Netherlands.</li>
                    <li> Khan left FDO when URENCO offered him a senior technical position, initially conducting studies on the uranium metallurgy.</li>
                    <li>Uranium enrichment is an extremely difficult process because uranium in its natural state is composed of just 0.71% of uranium-235 (U235), which is a fissile material, 99.3% of uranium-238 (U238), which is non-fissile, and 0.0055% of uranium-234 (U234), a daughter product which is also a non-fissile.</li>
                    <li>The URENCO Group utilised the Zippe-type of centrifugal method to electromagnetically separate the isotopes U234, U235, and U238 from sublimed raw uranium by rotating the uranium hexafluoride (UF6) gas at up to ~100,000 revolutions per minute (rpm).</li>
                    <li>Khan, whose work was based on physical metallurgy of the uranium metal,[32]: 87  eventually dedicated his investigations on improving the efficiency of the centrifuges by 1973–74.</li>
